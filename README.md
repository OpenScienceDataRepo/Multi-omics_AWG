# Multi-omics Analysis Working Group

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/about.html) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for Multi-omics AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**Multi-omics AWG Overview**  
The Multi-omics/Systems Biology Analysis Working Group is comprised of research scientists working together with a shared goal of determining the best pipelines and analysis that can be done to relate different omics platforms that include transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and methylation data. The group has developed cross-omics analysis through a network-based tool, and started visualization capabilities and participation with the GeneLab Visualization Working Group. The group's several projects have resulted in publications throughout the years, where they studied topics like mitochondrial stress and radiation driving spaceflight health risks by using transcriptomic and proteomic data. Muti-omics AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in space biology and muti-omics/system biology field.
